# Live Stocks Report

A live statistical report of the stocks is provided to analyse their respective gains and loss of the currency. The user is also provided with graphical representation of the same for better understanding.

## Demo

See [Demo (Custom URL)](http://live-stock.000webhostapp.com/) or [Demo (GitHub Page)](https://nitin-daddikar.github.io/Live-Stock/) 

Note: Currently project is using `ws://stocks.mnet.website` for WebSocket connection and GitHub Page is `HTTPS`, We cannot access `ws` connection from  `HTTPS` it has to be `wss`, so I have provided `custom URL` for demo.
